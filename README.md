**About the project**

This is my first attempt to code a site from scratch implementing responsive design. By using a combination of flex/grid/@media code, I have been able to create a site according to the design standards that looks good on many popular screen sizes.

**Techniques used**

- Flexbox
- Grid
- @media

**Further optimization**

To further the design of this site, I would add more @media detail, so that even more screen resolutions look good. This will lead to less "jarring" changes as one moves from a large screen size down to small.
